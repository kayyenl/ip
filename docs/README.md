# Muse: The task manager!

Muse is a simple app that organises your tasks.

## Features
We will cover the basic instructions here for you to get started. 
More commands can be found by our comprehensive guide within the app, with ```help```.

### Add a task
There are three types of tasks: todo, deadline and event. 

### Delete a task
By specifying the index which you wish to delete, Muse removes a task from your list of tasks.

### List all tasks
To get a view of all the current tasks.

### Mark/Unmark tasks as done or not done
With an "X", Muse helps to keep track of the tasks that you wish to be marked "done" or "undone". Similar to delete, you specify the index and duke will mark/unmark that task.

Here are the basic commands that you can do: 
- list out tasks  ```list```
- add a task ```todo mop the floor```
- mark/unmark tasks as done (or undone) ```mark 6```
- set deadlines & events too! ```deadline do assignment /by Monday```
- For the full instructions, simply ask muse with the following command:  ```help```
